# Show_me_the_Data_Structures

This exercise is part of the 2nd project of the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree Program. 

There are 6 exercises in total we have to submit successfully in order to pass this project. 

In this part of the course we learned different data structures, implemented different methods to manipulate them and studied efficiency to 
solve the problems in the less time possible. 

## Files Structure 

The filee structure is as follows:

1. problem_name.py - code solution and test for the problem
2. name_explanation.md - goal, approach and efficiency details of the code  
3. name_instruction.md - the problem's given instructions

Note: name is the problem's name respectively.

 ## Submission Instructions
 
It is important to:

* Answer all 6 problems listed in the previous concepts.

* Code solutions must be in a separate file like "problem_1.py". You can submit your answers by uploading a single .zip file or connecting to your GitHub repo.

* For each question, create a solution in Python (version 3). All solutions should be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed.

* In the respective "problem_1.py" files, include at least 3 test cases for each solution.
* For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console".
* On the next line, comment out the output you expect to see from that function call. At least 2 of these must be edge cases,                testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, etc.

* Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text file, PDF or markdown called "explanation_1.md".
* Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your    solution.
  
* Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.

Note: Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.

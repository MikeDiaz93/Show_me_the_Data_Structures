Problem 5 "Blockchain" 



Objective

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation. 



Approach

We implement a linked list where each block has a previuos and a next, and when we append values it creates a new block with a time stamp, and hash all the information and append the new block to the chain. 


Data Structure used: LinkedLists by blocks  


Efficiency :

    Time complexity:
        
        * O(1) -> Because We add block by block with their statements. 
      
    Space complexity:
        * O(n) -> Because We store all the blocks in the list.
